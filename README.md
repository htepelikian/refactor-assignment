# refactor-assignment

For this refactoring assignment, the following changes were incorporated!
1. Div portions of the HTML - a good amount of div's were changed to section, main, aside, etc to better format the document.
2. Images were missing alt attributes - therefore, those were added.
3. Imagaes were made to load properly through CSS
4. Benefits section was showing up wonky due to a jump to div title, div changed to section opening and closing
